## About the project

This app uses outputs from Artisan, an open-source software that assists coffee roasters record, analyze, and control roast profiles. It imports .alog files and displays roast curves. It uses Python code from Artisan to chart rate of rise (RoR) curves. There will soon be a cupping tab along with a tab to view past roasts. I hope to have a place where others can also import and view their roasts.

This app is a work in progress.
