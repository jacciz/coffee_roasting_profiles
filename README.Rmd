## About the project

This app uses outputs from Artisan, an open-source software that assists coffee roasters record, analyze, and control roast profiles. It imports .alog files and displays roast curves. There will soon be a cupping tab along with a tab to view past roasts. I hope to have a place where others can also import and view their roasts.

This app is a work in progress.
